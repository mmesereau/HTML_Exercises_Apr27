    <h1>Cities I've lived in</h1>
    <p>I was born in Akron, OH. I moved to Parker when I was four and stayed
      <br>there through High School.  I spent a year attending MSU at Bozeman.
      <br>I spent a summer working in Wall.  I spent a winter working as a ski
      <br> instructor in Ogden.  I spent a winter working at Mt Rushmore
      <br>in Keystone.  I spent a semester studying in Laramie.  I spent five
      <br>years living and studying in Aurora and Denver, and I moved to Fort
      <br>Collins three days ago.</p>
